# tfcb_capstone_kmckenna
 
This is my capstone project for TFCB due 12/16/20
I chose to use the Immunohistochemical typing of adenocarcinomas.
 data set can be found here https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.g8h71

My 3 research questions:
1. Can I reproduce their tidy data sets from their raw data and create Fig2A?
2. How well does anatomical diagnosis match up with the Immunohistochemical clustering?/Should we use IHC or anotomical location to classify patients?
3. Which 5 IHC markers are most differentially expressed by the Immunohistochemical clusters and can they help to identify certain clusters?

My repository is set up with 4 directories:
1. raw/ which includes 2 raw files from the paper- clinical data and raw
2. data/ which includes the tidy datasets- imputed, clustered, clustered_num, survival_
3. images/ which include the output answers for each question (labeled with Q1-Q3)
4. code/ which includes a script for each question. 2 Rmd and 1 ipynb labeled with Q1-Q3
